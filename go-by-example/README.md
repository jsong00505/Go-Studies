# Go by Example

This project is what I have studied Golang with ["Go by Example"](https://gobyexample.com/).
I use the site, ["Go by Example"](https://gobyexample.com/) and it looks helpful for beginner to lean Golang by themselves.
I hope this information to help your Golang study. If you have any question about Golang, please share with me.
I might not give you right answers but we can think about the problems together!

Enjoy your Golang study :) !
